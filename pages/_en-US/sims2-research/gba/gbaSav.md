## Notes
The Sims 2 GBA's used SAVSize is `0x5000`, but `0x5000 - 0xFFFF` is just unused space it seems, so technically for SAV Editors, a buffer of 0x5000 would even be enough.

`0x0 - 0xFFF` seems to be game metadata and settings related, while `0x1000 - 0x4FFF` is SAVSlot related. The game contains `4` Slots from a size of `0x1000` starting at `0x1000`.

It seems the game exist in EUR and USA variant... though SuperSaiyajinStackZ haven't gotten a USA version *yet*, but pretty sure the SAV Structure would be the same between both variants. Reports about, if the structure is the same would be appreciated in the [Universal-Team discord server](https://universal-team.net/discord) under the channel `#stackjects`.
