## Notes
The NDSSlot contains a Header part starting at `0x0 - 0x13`, however `0x10 - 0x11` does not count to it, because that seems like a shared Checksum between Main Slot and Header. Then `0x14 - 0xFFF` seems to be the Main part of the Slot.

It seems to contain 3 Checksums in place of a single Slot:

`0xE - 0xF`: Header Checksum

`0x10 - 0x11`: Shared Checksum

`0x28 - 0x29`: Main Checksum

However.. the Header part *MUST* match with the Shared Checksum.. and the Main part *MUST* match with the Shared Checksum as well, otherwise this is an invalid Checksum and the game `"corrupts"` the Header part, so the game doesn't detect it anymore. If that happened, then that Slot isn't usable, until the Header gets fixed, which can be fixed with the `NDSSLotFixer` Tool which can be found on the `External-Tools` page.

### Unique_Header_Note
A semi-valid header seems to be `0x64, 0x61, 0x74, 0x0, 0x20, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0` on the first 8 bytes. If the game noticed an invalid Checksum, it does store it as `0x2A, 0x2A, 0x2A, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0` instead. NOTE: DO NOT MODIFY THIS AT ALL! Otherwise it would not display the Slot either. It *MUST* be always `0x64, 0x61, 0x74, 0x0, 0x20, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0` to be detected.
